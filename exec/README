exec/ 

Directory that contains most of the scripts 
for generating, analyzing and plotting the 
results. It contains the following files: 

* function-block-builder.R - function for generating 
  block-structured matrices 
            
* generate-plots-BSS-time-limits.R - generates the plots
  for the effect of changing the time limits on the 
  performance of the BSS 
  
* generate-plots-semisynthetic.R - generates the plots 
  for the semisynthetic simulation study 
  
* generate-plots-synthetic.R - generates the plots 
  for the synthetic simulation study 
  
* install.R - checks whether the required packages are installed.
  If not, than the user is asked whether he/she agrees to download
  the required packages
  
* semisynthetic-example.R - runs the analysis for the semisyntethic
  simulation study. An example in which BSS is left out. 
  
* semisynthetic-example.R - runs the analysis for the semisyntethic
  simulation study. BSS is included. 
  
* time-limits-BSS-semisynthetic.R - runs the analysis for the effect
  that changing the time limits has on BSS. The semisynthetic simulation 
  is used. 
  
* time-limits-BSS-synthetic.R - runs the analysis for the effect
  that changing the time limits has on BSS. The synthetic simulation 
  is used. 

* stabilitySelectionSimulation.R - runs the simulation for the 
  stability selection

* selectionCriteriaSimulation.R - runs the simulation for BIC, HQC 
  and mBIC2

* generate-plots-corrDim-and-subsetSizes.R - generates the plots for
  the BSS/FSS/Lasso/Enet performance based on different subset sizes
  and the performance for correlation vs dimensionality

* generate-plots-selectionCriteria.R - generates plots for the 
  different selection criteria

* rename_plots.R - renames th created plots according to the Figures
  in the paper
